### July 17th Diary entry

- I took up the task of analyzing the cause of why the context is showing less number of dimensions. Long story short, as a part of realigning params in the scop as denoted by `scop->realignParams()` in `scopBuilder`, the actual space computed had in itself less number of dimensions, this is because another function `getFortranArrayIds()` is just concerned with the outermost dimension and not all the dimensions, which is actually incorrect to me. After discussion with the mentors, refactoring was done to check all the dimensions in the array. Surprisingly, PPCG code is now getting generated without any hinderance. Now the next step is to run it on a GPU enabled machine. That would take some amount of time, since I do not currently possess access to a GPU server.
