## July 26th Diary Entry

- There were some issues with my GPU server due to which I was unable to resume my work. mppf helped me in arranging the server at the right moment. I had spent time today getting used to the working of the server. Afterwards Polly and Chapel modules are also installed in it. The initial checks helped me to run the binaries on CPU and GPU.
