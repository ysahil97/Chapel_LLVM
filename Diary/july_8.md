## July 8th Diary Entry

- I tried to modify the bollu's patch of ShapeInfo for Chapel's code exclusively. Firstly, Chapel's intrinsic function name and the one polly detects should be made same. Then, Chapel's generated function signature is a bit different than what Polly expects, so temporary fixes have been put for now in the patch.With the help of that, on checking with gdb, the ShapeInfo object is really getting populated with Chapel's sizes and strides.

- In bollu's patch, there is a line which invalidates the scop due to delinearization. It is absurd in the function, so its removal is unnecessary. However, commenting it exposes it to a isl\_map assertion failure. The assertion failure occurs due to improper type of the array present in array part of the scop, namely `double MemRef5;` instead of `double MemRef5[*][%55];`. Because of this, Polly thinks that MemRef5 can only hold 1 value i.e its space is of length only 1, whereas the access space, which is obtained from access relation, namely `{ Stmt2[i0, i1, i2] -> MemRef5[o0, o1] : o0 = i0 and o1 = i1 }` gets `MemRef5[i0][i1]` whereby the access space has length 2. len(accessSpace) can never exceed len(arraySpace). So the generated SCoP is imperfect in this context and it needs to be fixed.
