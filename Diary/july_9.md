## July 9th diary entry

- Today, I tried to create a minimal test case which is causing isl\_map assertion failure. It is based on Chapel's 2D array initialization.

- In today's mentor meeting, there were plans to unify the ShapeInfo's sizes and stride interfaces which currently causes a lot of code spaghetti. The exact policy will be decided soon enough.
- Bollu has mentioned the exact point whereby the ShapeInfo interface influences Polly. This might be the starting point of the analysis of the assertion failure we are getting.
