### Working on the correctness of the earlier patch
- Today, I wanted to validate whether the order of load, which are checked to be invariant are in the same order as present in original IR. Not much of the work was done today, because the VPN through which I was accessing the LLVM repository for this project had been out of service. It wasn't fixed throughout the day despite mailing the concerned authorities. Also, I had to leave a bit early due to birthday celebrations.
