### Work Done
- Created a patch which eliminates usage of `isl_set_n_basic_set()`. Link is [here](https://reviews.llvm.org/D46935). It is committed to the Polly Codebase.

### Analysis Done
- Had a look over the IR generated from Chapel Code which does the task of initializing an array. It is present in the file `affine_initialization.ll` in code snippets folder.
