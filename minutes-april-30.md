# Minutes of meeting: Community bonding
##### Date: April 30th
### Goals for community bonding
- Get a build of chapel with LLVM running to we can generate LLVM from Chapel. 
- Fix a couple of bugs in polly / chapel to get familar with the codebase. Not necessary, but helpful.
- Walkthrough of the Chapel and Polly codebases for familiarity.

### Goals for first evaluation
- Get the first couple of simple examples (kernel that copies two 1-D arrays, kernel that initializes a 1-D array) working.
- If this is not possible, identify what the obstacle is, and have a plan for how to tackle the obstacle.
- If the goal is simple, spend time extending the example to handle more complex & realistic cases.

### Next meeting
- Due to Sahil's examinations, we will meet again in a week (7th May)
